## 3D Julia Set Visualization ##

Although this repository contains executable code, it is primarily intent for educational purposes.

This is a (Euclidean) 3D visualization of the 4D julia set structure.
3 dimensions are mapped onto orthogonal axes.
The 4th dimension is mapped onto a scalar which oscillates with respect to time.
